## 👋 Hello, I’m Dr. Sarva Jeganathan

I am a **Professor of Programming and Business Systems** with over **13 years of experience teaching programming at Humber Polytechnic**, alongside extensive experience teaching business and analytics courses across higher education.

My work focuses on **teaching programming effectively to diverse learners**—from beginners and non-CS majors to applied technology students—using **clear scaffolding, practice-driven labs, and industry-aligned assessments**.

## 🧑‍🏫 Teaching Focus

I specialize in designing and delivering programming courses that emphasize:

* Strong fundamentals before abstraction
* Hands-on, incremental learning through labs and projects
* Clear assessment criteria and transparent rubrics
* Academic rigor balanced with practical employability

I am particularly interested in **how students learn programming**, not just how code works.

## 📁 What You’ll Find on My GitHub

This GitHub profile serves as a **teaching portfolio**, showcasing:

* Complete course repositories (organized by week, labs, and assignments)
* Carefully designed programming labs with constraints and rubrics
* Sample projects and starter templates
* Teaching notes explaining *why* each lab or assignment exists
* Experiments with tooling to support grading, feedback, and student learning

Each repository reflects **real classroom use**, not theoretical examples.

## 🎯 Teaching Philosophy

> *Good programming education is not about speed or shortcuts—it is about clarity, structure, and confidence-building.*

I believe effective programming instruction should:

* Reduce cognitive overload
* Encourage disciplined problem decomposition
* Reward reasoning, not memorization
* Prepare students for both **academic success and workplace expectations**
